\Acknowledgments{%
I would like to thank my first supervisor, Prof. Dr. Alexander Wolff,
who we often call Sascha.
He is like a father and a friend to me.
Sascha is very patient to me.
When I first came to Germany, I could barely speak English.
Sascha had to spend a lot of effort to understand me
when we were doing research work together.
Sascha negotiated with my landlords to fight for my money.

the research work was challenging and exciting,
i enjoyed doing research work here in 


I would like to thank my second supervisor, Prof. Dr. Jan-Henrik Haunert.

I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Min Deng
for helping me get the chance of
pursuing my PhD in University of W\"urzburg.

I would like to thank Dr. Krzysztof Fleszar,
who helped me a lot during my study.
Having known that I had problems to understand a paper,
he even read that paper and then explained it to me.
%On the day of my defense, he sent his last set of comments about my slides at about 3:00 am.
He helped me move twice.
He has always invited me to join his parties, 
which reduced my homesickness. 

grateful to the university

freely take all kinds of courses

theoretical computer science and algorithms for data structures,
which are fundamental for computer science.

took English languages courses as well as a German language course.

I like that our group always had lunch together
so that we had plenty of chances to learn from each other.

thanks to my girlfriend.

%My sincerest thank is meant to my enthusiastic supervisor, 
%[Name]. My PhD has been an amazing experience and I thank 
%[Name] wholeheartedly, not only for his tremendous academic 
%support, but also for giving me so many wonderful 
%opportunities. I am particularly indebted to [Name] for his 
%constant faith in my lab work, all his contributions of 
%time, ideas, and funding to make my Ph.D. experience 
%productive and stimulating. 
%I am also hugely appreciative of [Name], especially for 
%sharing his (computing???) expertise so willingly, and for 
%being so dedicated to his role as my secondary supervisor, 
%and for his support when so generously hosting me in [City].
%A special acknowledgement goes to YOUR Collaborative team 
%[Name]. I praise the enormous amount of help and support by 
%[Name] throughout my stay in Paris. 
%Dozens of people have helped and taught me immensely at 
%Wuerzburg University. Special mention goes to cristoph??, 
%[Name], and [Name], for going far beyond the call of duty. 
%To [Name], for encouraging me to embark on the computer 
%science\Geography?? path, and for inspiring conversations. 
%And to [your other members], for nurturing my enthusiasm for 
%computer science. The group has been a source of friendships 
%as well as good advice and collaboration. I have very fond 
%memories of Squash time here. 
%For this dissertation I would like to thank my reading 
%committee members: [Name], [Name], and [Name] for their 
%time, interest, and helpful comments. 
%My time at Wuerzburg was made enjoyable and enriched in 
%large part due to the many friends and groups that became a 
%part of my life. I am grateful for time spent with flatmates 
%and friends, for my Football Team, Hotpot group, and Skiing 
%buddies. 
%Lastly, I would like to thank my family for all their love 
%and encouragement. For my parents who raised me with a love 
%of science and supported me in all my pursuits. And most of 
%all for my loving, supportive, and encouraging fianc√©e Fang 
%whose faithful support during the final stage of this Ph.D. 
%is so appreciated. Thank you.
